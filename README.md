My default development setting for any python project

- [python-poetry/poetry: Python dependency management and packaging made easy.](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

Following the [PEP 518 -- Specifying Minimum Build System Requirements for Python Projects | Python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/), we setting all config files in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) excepts [pre-commit](./pre-commit-config.yaml)
